    "# News Article Summarization and Keyword Extraction via NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will create an NLP pipeline that will summarize and extract keywords from a news article URL. We will be using state-of-the-art transformer models such as BERT to perform these NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will be using MLRun's real-time inference graphs to create the pipeline. This allows for easy containerization and deployment of our pipeline on top of a production-ready Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full pipeline will do the following:\n",
    "1. Retrieve news article text and metadata from URL using newspaper3k\n",
    "2. Summarize article text via Huggingface pipeline using DistilBart model\n",
    "3. Extract article keywords via KeyBERT using BERT-embeddings and cosine similarity\n",
    "4. Remove the original article text from the response (optional)\n",
    "5. Persist record in KV table"
