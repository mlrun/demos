# NetOps Demo: Predictive Network Operations/Telemetry

[Overview](#overview)&nbsp;| [Running the Demo](#demo-run)&nbsp;| [Demo Flow](#demo-flow)&nbsp;|  [Notebooks and Code](#notebooks-and-code)

> - This demo works with the online feature store, which is currently not part of the Open Source default deployment.

## Overview

This demo demonstrates how to build an automated machine-learning (ML) pipeline for predicting network outages based on network-device telemetry, also known as Network Operations (NetOps).
The demo implements feature engineering, model training, testing, inference, and model monitoring (with concept-drift detection).
The demo uses a offline/real-time metrics simulator to generate semi-random network telemetry data that is used across the pipeline.

The demo demonstrates how to:

- Manage MLRun projects.
- Use GitHub as a source for functions to use in pipeline workflows.
- Use the MLRun Feature Store to ingest, calculate and serve offline and real-time features.
- Use the MLRun Pipeline orchestration to run an automated train, test and deploy the pipeline, and track the results and artifacts.
- Use the MLRun Serving Graphs to build real-time ML applications and serve models.
- Use the MLRun Model monitoring and drift analysis.

> **Note:** The demo applications are tested on the [Iguazio Data Science Platform](https://www.iguazio.com) ("the platform"), and use the platform's data store ("v3io").

## Running the Demo

<a id="demo-run-prerequisites"></a>
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- A [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/).
- An installation of MLRun with a running MLRun service and an MLRun dashboard.
    See details in the [MLRun README](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun).

<a id="demo-execution-steps"></a>
### Execution Steps

Execute the following steps to run the demo:

1. Fork the [mlrun/demos](https://github.com/mlrun/demos) Git repository to your GitHub account.

2. In a client or notebook that is properly configured with MLRun, run the following code. Replace `<your fork>` with the name of your mlrun/demos GitHub fork:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your fork>.git
    cd demos/network-operations
    ```

3. Run the [**01-ingest.ipynb**](01-ingest.ipynb) notebook to create the feature sets and deploy the data generator and live ingestion endpoints.

4. Open the [**02-training-and-deployment.ipynb**](02-training-and-deployment.ipynb) notebook and follow the instructions to create a Feature Vector, and run an automated pipeline to train a model and deploy it for live, real-time predictions.

## Demo Flow

The demo consists of:
1. **Building** and testing features from three sources (device metadata, real-time device metrics, and real-time device labels) using the feature store
2. **Ingesting** the data using batch (for testing) or real-time (for production).
3. **Running** an automated ML pipeline (train, test, and deploy the model with data from the feature-store).
4. **Testing** the deployed real-time feature engineering and inference pipeline.
5. **Monitoring** the model serving data and metrics, and detecting drift.

### Feature Creation and Ingestion

In the feature creation stage you use MLRun's Feature Store to first define the features we are want to ingest and the operations we want to apply to them.  
In this demo you create three unique feature sets:
- **network-device metrics** &mdash; real-time network-device telemtry data such as CPU utilization, packet loss, latency, and throughput. You run real-time aggregations on top of these metrics with different time windows.
- **static network-device data** &mdash; static device data such as model and manufacturing country. The categorical features are one-hot-encoded to have them ready for model ingestion.
- **network-device failure label indicator** &mdash; a stream representing the label responses. Later on the Feature Store matches them with the correct sample for dataset creation.

After the the feature sets are defined you can ingest the features data using batch or real-time techniques.

<a id="model-training"></a>
### Automated Model Training and Deployment (CI/CD)

Now that the dataset is ready for training, define the model training, testing, and deployment process.

Build an automated ML pipeline using a pre-baked serverless training, testing and serving functions from [MLRun's functions marketplace](https://www.mlrun.org/marketplace/). The pipeline has three steps:
* **Train** a model using data from the feature vector you created and save it to the model registry.
* **Test** and evaluate the model with portion of the data.
* **Deploy** a real-time serving function that uses the newly trained model and enrich/impute the features with data from the real-time feature vector.

You can see the [**workflow code**](./src/workflow.py). You can run this workflow locally, in a CI/CD framework, or over Kubeflow. 
In practice you can create different workflows for development and production.

The workflow/pipeline can be executed using the MLRun SDK (`project.run()` method) or using CLI commands (`mlrun project`), 
and can run directly from the source repo (GIT). See details in MLRun [**Projects and Automation documentation**](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest/projects/overview.html).

<a id="model-Deployment-and-monitoring"></a>
### Data and Model Monitoring

The deployed real-time pipeline generates real-time telemetry and gathers the model inputs and outputs data. The telemetry 
metrics and real-time data are used for:
* Monitoring model activity, performance, health 
* Monitoring real-time model and data statistics, drift, and accuracy
* Gathering production data for use in post analysis (explanability) and re-training 

You can view the MLRun's Model Montoring results in the MLRun UI or in Grafana dashboards.
