It will begin unlike any other, with two cases being argued by teleconference due to the coronavirus pandemic. The court for the first time began hearing cases that way in May, and will continue doing so at least at the term s outset.\\nThe court building, where large crowds of mourners gathered outside after Ginsburg s death of Sept. 18, remains closed to the public because of the pandemic.\\nThe confluence of events is a test of leadership for conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, who in February also presided over a Senate impeachment trial that ended in Trump s acquittal on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for pressing Ukraine to investigate his Democratic election rival Joe Biden. \\nRoberts is known as a institutionalist who prizes the court s independence.\\n\\\"He would like to be a steady hand and wants the court to be on a steady path,\\\" said Nicole Saharsky, a lawyer who argues cases before the justices.\\nThe most anticipated case in the term s first week comes on Wednesday, when the justices weigh a multibillion-dollar software copyright dispute between Alphabet  Inc s Google and  Oracle Corp  . The case involves Oracle s accusation that Google infringed its software copyrights to build the Android operating system used in smartphones.\\nIn the Obamacare case, Barrett could cast a pivotal vote.\\nA group of Democratic-led states including California and New York are striving to preserve the 2010 law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, in a case in which Republican-led states and Trump s administration are trying to strike it down.\\nObamacare has helped roughly 20 million Americans obtain medical insurance either through government programs or through policies from private insurers made available in Obamacare marketplaces. It also bars insurers from refusing to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Republican opponents have called the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets.\\nThe Supreme Court previously upheld it 5-4 in a 2012 ruling in which Roberts cast the crucial vote. It rejected another challenge 6-3 in 2015. Ginsburg was in the majority both times.\\nBarrett in the past criticized those two rulings. Democrats opposing her nomination have emphasized that she might vote to strike down Obamacare, although legal experts think the court is unlikely to do so.\\nRELIGIOUS RIGHTS\\nThe court hears another major case on Nov. 4 concerning the scope of religious-rights exemptions to certain federal laws. The dispute arose from Philadelphia s decision to bar a local Roman Catholic entity from participating in the city s foster-care program because the organization prohibits same-sex couples from serving as foster parents.\\nThe justices already have tackled multiple election-related emergency requests this year, some related to rules changes prompted by the pandemic. More are likely.\\nThe conservative majority has sided with state officials opposed to courts imposing changes to election procedures to make it easier to vote during the pandemic.\\nTrump has said he wants Barrett to be confirmed before Election Day so she could cast a decisive vote in any election-related dispute, potentially in his favor. He has said he expects the Supreme Court to decide the outcome of the election, though it has done so only once - the disputed 2000 contest ultimately awarded to Republican George W. Bush.\\nDemocrats have said they will query Barrett during confirmation hearings set to begin on Oct. 12 on whether she should recuse herself in certain election-related cases. Justices have the final say on whether they step aside in a case.\\nJeffrey Rosen, president of the nonprofit National Constitution Center, said at an event on Friday hosted by the libertarian Pacific Legal Foundation that he expects the court either to stay out of major election cases or, if unable to do so, to try to reach a unanimous outcome.\\n\\\"The court s legitimacy is crucially important to all the justices in this extraordinarily fragile time,\\\" Rosen added. \\n\\nIf the court is divided 4-4 in any cases argued before a new justice is seated, it could hold a second round of oral arguments so the new justice could participate. \"], [\"2020-10-04 09:00:16\", \"GOOGL\", -0.5, \"https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/xrp-ledger-blockchain-energizes-decarbonization-but-tokenization-a-challenge-2315010\", \"As tech giants like Google  and Facebook  announce plans to become carbon-neutral businesses by 2030, smaller companies are doing the same.

News of Trump s hospitalization at a military medical center outside Washington, where he remained on Saturday, came after trading ended on Friday. \\nMany investors are concerned, however, that a serious decline in Trump\\u2019s health less than a month before Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3 could roil a U.S. stock market that recently notched its worst monthly performance since its selloff in March while causing turbulence in other assets. \\nIf the president\\u2019s health is in jeopardy, there s \\\"too much uncertainty in the situation for the markets just to shrug it off,\\\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \\nThe various outcomes investors currently envision run the gamut from a quick recovery that bolsters Trump s image as a fighter to a drawn-out illness or death stoking uncertainty and drying up risk appetite across markets. \\nShould uncertainty persist, technology and momentum stocks that have led this year s rally may be particularly vulnerable to a selloff, some investors said. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 2% on Friday, double the S&P 500 s decline. \\n\\\"If people ... get nervous right now, probably it manifests itself in crowded trades like tech and mega-cap being unwound a bit,\\\" Delwiche said\\nA record 80% of fund managers surveyed last month by BofA Global Research said that buying technology stocks was the market s \\\"most crowded\\\" trade. \\nThe concentration of investors in big tech stocks has also raised concerns over their outsized sway on moves in the broader market.\\nThe largest five U.S. companies \\u2013 Google parent Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Facebook , and Microsoft  \\u2013 now account for almost 25% of the S&P 500 s market capitalization, according to research firm Oxford Economics.\\nFISCAL STIMULUS TALKS\\nTrump\\u2019s diagnosis has intensified the spotlight on the fiscal stimulus talks in Washington, with investors saying agreement on another aid package could act as a stabilizing force on markets in the face of election-related uncertainty. \\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on Friday that negotiations were continuing, but she is waiting for a response from the White House on key areas. \\nFresh stimulus could speed economic healing from the impact of the pandemic, which has put millions of Americans out of work, and benefit economically-sensitive companies whose stock performance has lagged this year, investors said. \\nFor those who are underweight stocks, \\\"we would be using this volatility as an opportunity to increase equities because we think we re in an early-stage economic recovery,\\\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory.\\nMarket action on Friday suggested some investors may have been positioning for a stimulus announcement in the midst of the selloff.\\nThe S&P 500 sectors representing industrials and financials, two groups that are more sensitive to a broad economic recovery, rallied 1.1% and 0.7%, respectively, while the broader index declined.\\nEven with worries over Trump s condition, \\\"the fiscal program has been the loudest noise in the market,\\\" said Arnim Holzer, macro and correlation defense strategist at EAB Investment Group.\\nInvestor hedges against election-related market swings put in place over the last few months may have softened Friday s decline and could, to a degree, mitigate future volatility, said Christopher Stanton of hedge fund Sunrise Capital Partners LLC.\\nDespite Trump s illness, futures on the Cboe Volatility Index continued to show expectations of elevated volatility after the Nov. 3 vote, a pattern consistent with concerns of a contested election.\\nNagging doubts over whether the Republican president would agree to hand over the keys to the White House if he loses have grown in recent weeks. During his first debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Tuesday, Trump declined to commit to accepting the results, repeating his unfounded complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud.\\n\\n\\\"If Trump s health does not recover ... then he might give up on contesting the election,\\\" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.

This is Point/Counterpoint.\\nThe Bull Case\\nPalantir provides governments and corporations with the tools required to organize and glean insights from mounds of data, helping in areas as varied as detailing the spread of the novel coronavirus to tracking the activities of terrorists.\\nThe U.S. data analytics firm made its debut on New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday, after years of speculation, via a direct listing and without the usual razzmatazz surrounding a traditional IPO. \\nIt\\u2019s true the stock is trading below its $10 opening price, but this is still well above its reference price of $7.25 and things are likely to look very different when the Street starts its coverage.\\nThe company has yet to make a profit, but surely that won t be long in coming given its losses in the first six months of 2020 totaled $164 million, down from $280 million the same period a year prior.\\nPalantir anticipates 42% revenue growth in 2020 to about $1.06 billion, according to a filing earlier this week, with gross margins for the first half of this year at an impressive 73%. It also forecasts revenue growth of more than 30% next year. \\nPalantir was formed in 2003 in the wake of the 9-11 attacks, with its first major backer \\u2013 the CIA\\u2019s venture arm, In-Q-Tel. It was one of the first companies in this space and thus has had a head start in developing the required technology.\\nWhile Palantir still analyzes large amounts of data for U.S. government defense and intelligence agencies -- contracts which tend to be frequently rolled over -- the private sector has become increasingly more important. \\nIn fact, Palantir now says that a little more than half of its customers come from the private sector instead of governments. And there will undoubtedly be increasing demand from companies given the massive amounts of data they generate.\\n\\\"Broadly speaking Covid has been a tailwind for our business,\\\" Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said in a recent interview. \\\"We started 83 new engagements with customers in the first three weeks of Covid without getting on a plane.\\\"\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has forced companies to revisit how they do business, and the Covid era doesn\\u2019t look like ending anytime soon.\"], [\"2020-10-03 11:30:27\", \"GOOGL\", -0.76, \"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/paytm-other-indian-startups-vow-to-fight-big-daddy-googles-clout-sources-2314771\", \"By Aditya Kalra\\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Dozens of India s technology startups, chafing at Google s local dominance of key apps, are banding together to consider ways to challenge the U.S. tech giant, including by lodging complaints with the government and courts, executives told Reuters.\\nAlthough Google, owned by Alphabet Inc , has worked closely with India s booming startup sector and is ramping up its investments, it has recently angered many tech companies with what they say are unfair practices.\\nSetting the stage for a potential showdown, entrepreneurs held two video conferences this week to strategise, three executives told Reuters.\\n\\\"It s definitely going to be a bitter fight,\\\" said Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of e-commerce firm IndiaMART . \\\"Google will lose this battle. It s just a matter of time.\\\"\\nHe said executives have discussed forming a new startup association aimed chiefly at lodging protests with the Indian government and courts against the Silicon Valley company.\\nNearly 99% of the smartphones of India s half a billion users run on Google s Android mobile operating system. Some Indian startups say that allows Google to exert excessive control over the types of apps and other services they can offer, an allegation the company denies.\\nThe uproar began last month when Google removed popular payments app Paytm from its Play Store, citing policy violations. This led to a sharp rebuke from the Indian firm s founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, whose app returned to the Google platform a few hours later, after Paytm made certain changes.\\nIn a video call on Tuesday, Sharma called Google the \\\"big daddy\\\" that controls the \\\"oxygen supply of (app) distribution\\\" on Android phones, according to an attendee. He urged the roughly 50 executives on the call to join hands to \\\"stop this tsunami.\\\"\\n\\\"If we together don t do anything, then history will not be kind to us. We have to control our digital destiny,\\\" Sharma said.\\nOne idea raised was to launch a local rival to Google s app store, but Sharma said this would not be immediately effective given Google s dominance, one source said.\\nSharma and Paytm, which is backed by Japan s SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), did not respond to requests for comment.\\nGoogle declined to comment. It has previously said its policies aim to protect Android users and that it applies and enforces them consistently on developers.\\nSTRAINING TIES\\nThis week the U.S. company angered some Indian startups by deciding to enforce a 30% commission it charges on payments made within apps on the Android store.\\nTwo dozen executives were on a call on Friday where many slammed that decision. They discussed filing antitrust complaints and approaching Google s India head for discussions, said two sources with direct knowledge of the call.\\nParticipants included sports technology firm Dream Sports, backed by U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global, social media company ShareChat and digital payments firm PhonePe, the sources said. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\\nGoogle defends the policy, saying 97% of apps worldwide comply with it.\\nGoogle already faces an antitrust case related to its payments app in India and a competition investigation into claims it abused Android s dominant position. The company says it complies with all laws. \\nThese spats strain Google s strong ties to Indian startups. It has invested in some and helped hundreds with product development.

News of Trump s hospitalization at a military medical center outside Washington, where he remained on Saturday, came after trading ended on Friday. \\nMany investors are concerned, however, that a serious decline in Trump\\u2019s health less than a month before Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3 could roil a U.S. stock market that recently notched its worst monthly performance since its selloff in March while causing turbulence in other assets. \\nIf the president\\u2019s health is in jeopardy, there s \\\"too much uncertainty in the situation for the markets just to shrug it off,\\\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. \\nThe various outcomes investors currently envision run the gamut from a quick recovery that bolsters Trump s image as a fighter to a drawn-out illness or death stoking uncertainty and drying up risk appetite across markets. \\nShould uncertainty persist, technology and momentum stocks that have led this year s rally may be particularly vulnerable to a selloff, some investors said.
